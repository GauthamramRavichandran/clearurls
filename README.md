# ClearURLs BOT

A (_minimalist_) telegram bot to provide clean urls (i.e., removes any tracking info on the url (looking at you, **Facebook** and **Google** ðŸ˜‰))

2. Replace those values in `CONFIG.py`
3. Create a virtualenv and install the `requirements.txt`
4. Start the bot, `python main_file.py`
